#robotfindskitten implementation in rust (see http://www.robotfindskitten.org/)

Works in Windows and Linux

(heart does not display properly on Linux for some reason (possibly a curses issue)),

will probably work on OS X but I can't test it.

robotfindskitten is a cool little game-like zen simulation.

There are many implementation but none in rust so I decided to write one.

P.S. If someone could make a minimally functional windows/*nix terminal ui library for rust it would be really useful.
